# Tavern App

***"Tinder for D&D Groups"***

This is actually system agnostic and will allow you to search for any game by any publisher, but "Tinder for D&D" sums it up nicely.

This CRUD web app enables table-top role-playing gamers to connect with each other to play their favorite games at an agreed time and place, whether in person or remotely. 

This is a known pain point for would-be players, many struggling to find a full group or a game master / dungeon master. Most other means of finding an adventuring party ammount to little more than an iteration on the personals board. Nothing else exists in this space for worldwide, searchable, filterable, and rapid gaming group creation.
